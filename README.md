This is a plugin for Unreal Engine where I have collected animation assets so that I don't have to look for them again when creating each new project.

I do not know if it is legal to use these assets in commercial projects, so approach this issue with all your caution and responsibility.

Sources from where the animation assets for this plugin were taken:
